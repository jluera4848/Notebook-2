As the loop of `is_prime` goes on and on, it might take your computer a long time!  If each step of the loop takes only a nanosecond (1 billionth of a second), the loop would take about a second when executing `is_prime(1000000001)`.  If you tried `is_prime` on a much larger number, like `is_prime(2**101 - 1)`, the loop would take longer than the lifetime of the Earth.\n",

It just remembers the endpoints, and how to proceed from one number to the next.  In the older version, Python 2.x, the range command `range(2,n)` would have tried to store the entire list of numbers `[2,3,4,...,n-1]` in the memory of your computer.  Your computer has some (4 or 8 or 16, perhaps) gigabytes of memory (RAM).  A gigabyte is a billion bytes, and a byte is enough memory to store a number between 0 and 255.  (More detail about this later!).  So a gigabyte will not even hold a billion numbers.  So our `is_prime` function would have led to memory problems in Python 2.x, but in Python 3.x we don't have to worry (for now) about space."

Type errors are meant for situations where a variable belongs to the wrong type.  `TypeError` is just one kind of \"exception\" -- the full built-in hierarchy of exceptions can be found in the [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#exception-hierarchy).\n",

Both positive and negative numbers can be represented as floats, so the error doesn't represent the *wrong type*.  The error represents a *bad value*.  "

But in this setting, it is safe, and makes no real difference to the Python interpreter.  Instead of creating new variables called `dividend` and `divisor`, one can manipulate `a` and `b` directly within the function.  If you do this, the GCD function can be shortened to the following."

Hint:  the function should contain the lines `j = 2` and `while j < n:` and `j = j + 1` in various places.  Why might this be an improvement from the for loop?  Can you look for factors within a smaller range?\n",
